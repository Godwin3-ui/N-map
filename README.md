# N-map

📌 Overview

This repository contains my practical work with Nmap and Scapy, reproduced from our cybersecurity lab sessions. The goal of this assignment was to solidify my understanding of network scanning, packet crafting, and basic protocol analysis through hands-on practice.

🛠️ Tools Used
	•	Nmap – Host discovery, port scanning, service/OS detection, basic scripting
	•	Scapy – Packet creation, sending, sniffing, protocol inspection
	•	Wireshark – Traffic analysis and verification

⸻

 Nmap Tasks Completed
	•	Host discovery scans (ping scans, ARP scans)
	•	Port enumeration (TCP SYN, TCP connect, UDP scans)
	•	Service/version detection
	•	OS fingerprinting
	•	NSE scripting (basic examples)

Includes:
	•	Commands used
	•	Short explanations for each scan
	•	Screenshots of results

⸻

 Scapy Tasks Completed
	•	Crafting and sending simple packets
	•	Sniffing live traffic
	•	Inspecting packet layers (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP)
	•	Basic protocol analysis

Includes:
	•	Code snippets
	•	Output summaries
	•	Screenshots where needed

🎯 Key Learnings
	•	How host discovery and port scanning reveal network exposure
	•	The importance of understanding packets at the protocol level
	•	How attackers map networks — and how defenders can detect it
	•	Why accurate documentation matters in real-world cybersecurity
